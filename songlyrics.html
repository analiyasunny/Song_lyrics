                <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
                <p>
                    The snow glows white on the mountain tonight<br>
                    Not a footprint to be seen<br>
                    A kingdom of isolation<br>
                    And it looks like I'm the queen<br>
                    The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br>
                    Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried<br>
                    Don't let them in, don't let them see<br>
                    Be the good girl you always have to be<br>
                    Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know<br>
                    Well, now they know<br>
                    Let it go, let it go<br>
                    Can't hold it back anymore<br>
                    Let it go, let it go<br>
                    Turn away and slam the door<br>
                    I don't care what they're going to say<br>
                    Let the storm rage on<br>
                    The cold never bothered me anyway<br>
                    It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small<br>
                    And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all<br>
                    It's time to see what I can do<br>
                    To test the limits and break through<br>
                    No right, no wrong, no rules for me<br>
                    I'm free<br>
                    Let it go, let it go<br>
                    I am one with the wind and sky<br>
                    Let it go, let it go<br>
                    You'll never see me cry<br>
                    Here I stand and here I stay<br>
                    Let the storm rage on<br>
                    My power flurries through the air into the ground<br>
                    My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br>
                    And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br>
                    I'm never going back, the past is in the past<br>
                    Let it go, let it go<br>
                    And I'll rise like the break of dawn<br>
                    Let it go, let it go<br>
                    That perfect girl is gone<br>
                    Here I stand in the light of day<br>
                    Let the storm rage on<br>
                    The cold never bothered me anyway<br>
                </p>
